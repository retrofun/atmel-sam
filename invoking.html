<h2>Introduction</h2>

Sam_I_Am is invoked from the command line within a terminal/shell/console
program (rxvt, xterm, Konsole, gnome-terminal, etc.) After opening a console,
you should simply be able to type:

<pre>    Sam_I_Am --version</pre>

This will verify that Sam_I_Am is properly installed and accessible. If this
does not work, you need to find out where Sam_I_Am was installed. Type the
following:

<pre>    python -c "import sys; print sys.prefix+'/lib/python'+sys.version[:3]"</pre>

You should see a directory name such as <tt>/usr/lib/python2.3</tt>. You can
then invoke Sam_I_Am as follows:

<pre>    python /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/Sam_I_Am/samiam.py</pre>

If this still does not work, try the <a href="index.html#Installation">Installation</a> instructions again.

<p><a name="Options"></a>
<h2>Command-Line Options</h2>

By default, simply typing <tt>Sam_I_Am</tt> will perform the following tasks:
<ol>
<li>Find and execute the commands in any startup script files (see the <a href="#RCFiles">Startup Files</a> below)</li>
<li>Enter an interactive command mode</li>
</ol>

The following command-line options modify this default behavior:

<dl>
<dt><b><tt>-x FILE</tt></b> or <b><tt>--rc-file=FILE</tt></b></dt>
<dd>The default startup script file is either <tt>.samiamrc</tt> in the current directory or, if not found, the file
<tt>.samiamrc</tt> in the HOME directory (i.e., <tt>${HOME}/.samiamrc</tt>). With this option specified, however,
the startup script file in this option is used instead.</dd>

<dt><b><tt>-X</tt></b> or <b><tt>--norc-file</tt></b></dt>
<dd>This option prevents Sam_I_Am from executing any startup script files.</dd>

<dt><b><tt>-i</tt></b> or <b><tt>--interactive</tt></b></dt>
<dd>Normally, when command-line commands are given (see the <a href="#SingleCmds">Command-Line Commands</a> section below) Sam_I_Am will
perform those commands and exit. With this option specified, Sam_I_Am will
perform the commands and then remain in interactive mode.</dd>
</dl>

Finally, the <tt>--help</tt> and <tt>--version</tt> command-line options print a brief help summary and program
version, respectively.

<p><a name="RCFiles"></a>
<h2>Startup Files</h2>

Sam_I_Am can execute a sequence of commands stored in a file every time it runs. This behavior can be useful to, for
example, automatically connect to SAM-BA, set protected memory regions, and so on.

<p>In its normal mode of operation, Sam_I_Am looks in the current directory for a file named <tt>.samiamrc</tt>. If
found, the commands in this file are executed as if they had been typed by you at the keyboard in interactive mode.
Once all commands are executed, Sam_I_Am enters interactive mode in which you can begin typing your own commands.

<p>If no <tt>.samiamrc</tt> file is found in your current directory, the same file name is loaded, if it exists,
from your home directory (i.e., <tt>${HOME}/.samiamrc</tt>). If this file does not exist here either, then no startup
file is loaded.

<p>Here is a sample <tt>.samiamrc</tt> file that opens a connection to SAM-BA, prints the SAM-BA version, then
sets allowable memory accesses to correspond to the memory map of an AT91SAM7S256 device:
<pre>
      open /dev/ttyUSB0
      version
      set readallow 0 0x300000
      set ramwriteallow 0x202000 57344
      set flashwriteallow 0x100000 0x40000
</pre>      
<p>Sam_I_Am can be told to either ignore startup files or execute a startup
file other than <tt>.samiamrc</tt> depending upon the command-line options
presented in the previous section.

<p><a name="SingleCmds"></a>
<h2>Command-Line Commands</h2>

Additional arguments to Sam_I_Am on the command line are interpreted as
commands as if they were typed in interactive mode. These commands are
performed <i>after</i> executing any startup files. For example:
<pre>
    Sam_I_Am dump 0x202000
</pre>
The above command would rely upon the presence of a <tt>.samiamrc</tt> file
that contained an <tt>open</tt> command so that the <tt>dump</tt> command would
be successful.

<p>Multiple commands can be executed by separating them with isolated commas.
After all commands are performed, Sam_I_Am exits (unless the <b><tt>-i</tt></b>
or <b><tt>--interactive</tt></b> command-line option is specified).

<p>For example:
<pre>
    Sam_I_Am open /dev/ttyUSB0 , send program.hex , go
</pre>
The above command opens the device port (assuming no <tt>.samiamrc</tt> file
does so), uploads a HEX file, and runs the program uploaded. As soon as the GO
command is issued, Sam_I_Am exits (though the uploaded program continues to
run).

<p>The following example uses the <tt>source</tt> command to effectively execute two
startup files, <tt>.samiamrc</tt> and <tt>run.sam</tt>, and then remain in
interactive mode to accept more commands:
<pre>
    Sam_I_Am -i source run.sam
</pre>
